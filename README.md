# Create Zephyr WorkSpace 
========================
Install west:
``` Bash

pip3 install -U west

```
Get the Zephyr source code:
``` Bash
west init ~/zephyrproject
cd ~/zephyrproject
west update
```

Change zephyr git version


Current I'm use zephyr version 3.5 stable

https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/tree/v3.5-branch


---
Export a Zephyr CMake package. This allows CMake to automatically load boilerplate code required for building Zephyr applications.

```Bash
west zephyr-export
```

Zephyrâ€™s scripts/requirements.txt file declares additional Python dependencies. Install them with pip3.
```
pip3 install -r ~/zephyrproject/zephyr/scripts/requirements.txt
```

After, i will see the folder zephyrproject with file  tree as below:

# Create Your Application
========================

``` Bash

cd  ~/zephyproject
mkdir personal

```

![Alt Text](image/2.createproject.png)

Add some file to make it become a basic CMake Project

With me, I create a personal project and create a **addition** folder esp32s3 to make project for **esp32s3**, If you have not more project, can you create a basic project within personal folder

![Alt Text](image/3.make_basic.png)

Build

Run this command to build your application

```
cd ~/zephyrproject
west build -b [your board name] ./personal/esp32s3

```
